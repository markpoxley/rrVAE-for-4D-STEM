The note book contained here allows the reproduction of the results of the paper 'Probing atomic-scale symmetry breaking by rotationally invariant machine learning of multidimensional electron scattering, Mark P. Oxley, Maxim Ziatdinov, Ondrej Dyck, Andrew R. Lupini, Rama Vasudevan & Sergei V. Kalinin, npj Computational Materials volume 7, Article number: 65 (2021) '   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00527-3 .  

Please note that this notebook is highly modified from the original notebook to incorporate the latest version of atomai.  This results in the slightly different convergence behavior to the published results.   

Presently only the simulated data is available.  The experimental notebook will be added once the preprocessing has been tidied up.
